# react-three

npm init

## create-react-app

```sh
npx create-react-app .
```
https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/
that means you have different way to init it.

## three.js

```sh
npm install three @types/three @react-three/fiber
npm install @types/three
```

然后不会了，怎么跑起来啊。
